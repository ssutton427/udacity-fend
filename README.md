# Udacity | Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

![](udacity_fend_cert.png)

> The Front End Developer Nanodegree program is comprised of 8 projects. With each project, you'll create something that demonstrates your mastery of in-demand skills. Projects range in complexity, and each builds upon the previous. In the end, you will have a resume-worthy portfolio that you can showcase to prospective employers.


Udacity has been a interesting/knowledge filled journey for me. My resilience and determination helped me get through the tough times of failed projects. I really learned how to use all available resources, study, and apply myself fully. I am grateful that I was awarded this opportunity; it not only gave me much needed experience but it also gave me the fuel to not stop here, keep going and keep learning!
