I used google maps and api key service.
I used knockout for the script file to create binds, observables, and separate concerns.
I used foursquare for my venues and api.
I styled the filter to show the filter and styled the input to be responsive.
Changed the sidebar width and height to be more responsive.
To run the map
1: clone or download it from the github
2: extract the files
3: open the index.html in the browser
